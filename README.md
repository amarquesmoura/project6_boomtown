# Boomtown üèô

This is a full stack project at RED Academy App Developer Program. In the back-end, it uses Postgres as the database server, Node.js with Express for web services and Apollo for GraphQL queries. It is a website for sharing goods, lending and borrowing them.

## Main Takeaways

In this project, I learned modern techonologies for integrating the back-end. Here are some of the main takeaways:

- Although not a new technology, SQL is a solid, tried and true way to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data.
- Node.js brings the flexibility of Javascript to the server side. In conjunction with libraries like Express, it is very easy to instantiate a web server.
- RESTful APIs are a straightforward method to add and retrieve data from an HTTP server. However, they present limitations when the complexity of the data or the queries is high.
- To deal with more complex database interactions, GraphQL is a powerful tool. One can use a library like Apollo to integrate GraphQL into a web server as a middleware.
